## Common Tasks

### Adding New Features
1. Update database schema in `prisma/schema.prisma` if needed
2. Run `npx prisma db push` to update database
3. Update TypeScript types
4. Add API routes in `app/api/`
5. Update frontend components

### Debugging
- Check browser console for client-side errors
- Check terminal for server-side errors
- Use `console.log` in API routes for debugging
- Use Prisma Studio to inspect database: `npx prisma studio`

### Troubleshooting Database Issues
- If Prisma can't connect to Neon database, check if environment variables are cached
- Close terminal completely and open fresh one to clear cached environment variables
- Verify DATABASE_URL in `.env.local` matches Neon dashboard connection string
- Ensure Neon database is awake (databases sleep after inactivity)

### Testing Integrations
