● Perfect! I've successfully committed and pushed all the changes to GitHub. The commit includes:

  ✅ Successfully Pushed to GitHub:
  - Fixed authentication middleware syntax (auth.protect() vs auth().protect())
  - Added /book route to public routes for guest bookings
  - Fixed pricing calculation infinite loop in SummaryStep useEffect
  - Fixed DashboardErrorBoundary import from correct file
  - Implemented User Profile API for dashboard data
  - Added comprehensive error boundaries and loading states
  - Completed end-to-end booking flow testing with service pricing
  - Added authentication flow components and dashboard navigation

  The repository is now up to date with all the authentication and dashboard integration fixes. The booking system is working end-to-end with proper
  pricing calculations ($290 total including services), and we've resolved the key issues that were preventing the dashboard from working properly.

> I'm thinking of a new workflow, I'm just trying to find a logical way. I think on booking dot 100% canine we're going to have a real simple design and 
  then we're going to have a CTA for login and also for "create a user". From there, the user will create their account and then I think we'll have an 
  option. Can you come up with some ideas on how we should do the pages for the customer journey?

● I'll help you design a logical customer journey workflow for the booking system. Let me first understand the current structure and then propose some
  ideas.

● Based on my analysis of your current system, I have several ideas for improving the customer journey workflow. Here are some options:

  Customer Journey Workflow Ideas

  Option 1: Account-First Approach (Recommended)

  This creates a clear separation between guest browsing and authenticated experiences:

  1. Landing Page (booking.100percentk9.co.nz)
    - Simple, focused design with clear value proposition
    - Two primary CTAs: "Sign In" and "Create Account"
    - Secondary option: "Browse as Guest" (smaller, less prominent)
  2. Account Creation Flow
    - /sign-up → Account creation
    - /onboarding → New user onboarding wizard:
        - Welcome & introduction to services
      - Add first dog profile (optional but encouraged)
      - Tour of dashboard features
      - Option to start booking immediately or explore
  3. Authenticated User Journey
    - Dashboard becomes the hub for all activities
    - Quick booking from saved dog profiles
    - Booking history and upcoming stays visible
    - Personalized recommendations

  Option 2: Booking-Led Registration

  Start with intent, then capture account:

  1. Landing Page
    - "Book Now" as primary CTA (guest-friendly)
    - "Sign In" for returning customers
  2. Guest Booking Flow
    - /book/guest → Start booking as guest
    - After selecting dates/services, prompt to create account
    - "Save time on future bookings - create your account"
    - Complete booking with account creation in one flow
  3. Account Benefits Showcase
    - Show what they gain: saved dogs, booking history, faster checkout
    - Optional: Offer first-time booking discount for account creation

  Option 3: Hybrid Progressive Approach

  Best of both worlds:

  1. Smart Landing Page
    - Detect returning visitors (cookie-based)
    - Show personalized CTAs based on status
    - New visitors: "Get Started" → leads to tour
    - Return visitors: "Continue Booking" or "Sign In"
  2. Interactive Tour
    - /get-started → Interactive tour page
    - Show service options with pricing
    - "Try Our Booking System" (guest mode)
    - "Create Account for Full Access"
  3. Progressive Enhancement
    - Start as guest, gradually encourage account creation
    - Show "Save & Continue Later" at any point
    - Email capture for abandoned bookings

  Option 4: Service-First Discovery

  Focus on what you offer before asking for commitment:

  1. Service Explorer Landing
    - /services as main entry point
    - Interactive service cards with details
    - "Check Availability" on each service
    - This triggers sign-up/sign-in flow
  2. Availability Calendar
    - /availability → Public calendar view
    - Shows available dates without personal data
    - "Reserve These Dates" → Account required
  3. Personalized Booking
    - After account creation, pre-fill selected dates
    - Guide through dog profile creation
    - Complete booking with context

  Recommended Implementation Plan

  Based on your needs, I recommend Option 1 (Account-First) with elements from Option 3:

  Page Structure:

  1. / (Landing) - Simple, clean with clear CTAs
  2. /sign-up - Account creation (existing)
  3. /sign-in - Sign in (existing)
  4. /onboarding - New user wizard (new)
  5. /book - Booking form (enhance for auth users)
  6. /book/guest - Guest booking with conversion prompts (new)
  7. /dashboard - User hub (existing, enhance)
  8. /services - Service information page (new)
  9. /about - Trust-building content (new)

  Key Features to Add:

  - Onboarding wizard for new users
  - Guest booking with strategic conversion points
  - Service showcase pages for SEO and discovery
  - Smart redirects based on user state
  - Abandoned booking recovery via email
  - Social proof throughout the journey

> Other thing to think about is when someone wants to rebook instead of going through that form again, they can just choose the services as I want them to 
  be able to update their personal details on the record.

  Also thinking about allowing users to be able to send photos or images or PDFs or upload them for vet books. Photos of vaccinations could be even a photo
   of the dog. All those things. So we need a storage as well. Yeah, add that in. Also, I don't like the purple. Go on to our main page and have a look at 
  the color scheme. We do not have purple on ours, so don't use purple. Also, our logo was not on there. If you create a pictures folder for images, I'll 
  put it in. Or if you're able to get it from the website 100%canine.co.nz, then that'll be good. Other than that, I can put it in if you want.

✻ Thinking…

  The user is providing additional requirements:
  1. For rebooking, they want users to be able to just choose services (not go through the whole form again)
  2. Users should be able to update their personal details on the record
  3. Need file upload capability for:
    - Photos/images
    - PDFs 
    - Vet books
    - Vaccination photos
    - Photos of the dog
  4. Need storage solution for these files
  5. Don't use purple color - need to check the actual 100%canine.co.nz website for correct colors
  6. Need to get the actual logo from 100%canine.co.nz or create a pictures folder for the user to add it
  
  Let me check the actual website to understand the correct color scheme and try to get the logo.

● I'll check the actual 100% Canine website to understand the correct color scheme and see if I can get the logo, then revise the plan with your additional
   requirements.

● Fetch(https://100percentk9.co.nz)

  The website fetch failed. Let me try without the percent encoding.

● Perfect! Now I have the correct brand colors. Let me check the current color usage in the system and then create a comprehensive plan that addresses all
  your requirements.

> If you can't get the right one, use Playwright to take screenshots.

● I'll use Playwright to take a screenshot of the actual 100% K9 website to see the correct branding and colors.

● playwright - Navigate to a URL (MCP)(url: "https://www.100percentk9.co.nz")
  ⎿  ### Ran Playwright code

● I'll take a screenshot of the website to capture the actual branding and colors.
